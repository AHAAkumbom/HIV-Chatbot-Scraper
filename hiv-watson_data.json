Il correspond au moment o\u00f9 le syst\u00e8me immunitaire ne fonctionne plus, les lymphocytes T ayant pour la plupart \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits par le virus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cause de cela, les personnes infect\u00e9es peuvent d\u00e9velopper sur le long terme des maladies dites \u00ab opportunistes \u00bb. L\u2019appellation de ces maladies vient du fait qu\u2019elles sont caus\u00e9es par des micro-organismes habituellement inoffensifs pour les personnes dont le syst\u00e8me immunitaire fonctionne normalement. Les maladies opportunistes comprennent notamment des infections d\u2019origine bact\u00e9rienne, fongique et parasitaire, ainsi que certains cancers.\n\n\nQuels sont les sympt\u00f4mes\u00a0?\n\n\nLes sympt\u00f4mes de l\u2019infection par le VIH \u00e9voluent selon le stade de la maladie. Dans les premi\u00e8res semaines, la personne infect\u00e9e peut rester asymptomatique ou bien d\u00e9velopper les sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019une phase appel\u00e9e \nprimo-infection\n. Celle-ci\n se caract\u00e9rise par\n \ndes signes cliniques comparables \u00e0 ceux rencontr\u00e9s en cas de grippe\n : forte fi\u00e8vre, douleurs musculaires, maux de t\u00eate, diarrh\u00e9e...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr\u00e8s la primo-infection, d\u00e9bute une phase asymptomatique qui peut durer plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\n Durant cette phase, le virus est pr\u00e9sent et les personnes infect\u00e9es restent contagieuses. Le VIH affaiblissant progressivement le syst\u00e8me immunitaire, la maladie finit par entra\u00eener l\u2019apparition d\u2019autres sympt\u00f4mes\u202f: perte de poids, infections de la peau, toux, fi\u00e8vre et diarrh\u00e9e.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSi aucun traitement n\u2019est suivi, la maladie \u00e9volue vers le sida, stade ultime de l\u2019infection par le VIH.\n\n\n\n\nComment se transmet le VIH\u00a0?\n\n\nLe virus de l\u2019immunod\u00e9ficience humaine (ou VIH)\n se transmet par voie sexuelle et sanguine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIl peut aussi se transmettre de la m\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019enfant. Cette transmission peut avoir lieu\u202f:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- soit lors du dernier trimestre de la grossesse, le virus pouvant passer de la m\u00e8re au f\u0153tus via le placenta\u202f;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- soit lors de l\u2019accouchement\u202f;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- soit lors de l\u2019allaitement.\n\n\n\n\nComment diagnostiquer l\u2019infection\u00a0?\n\n\nLe diagnostic de l\u2019infection par le VIH est pos\u00e9 par un examen sanguin de \nd\u00e9pistage\n.\n Ce test est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 la suite d\u2019un comportement \u00e0 risque (rapport sexuel sans protection, \u00e9change de seringues...) ou lorsqu\u2019apparaissent certains sympt\u00f4mes. Un d\u00e9pistage pr\u00e9coce de l\u2019infection par VIH permet \u00e0 la personne de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un traitement d\u2019autant plus efficace qu\u2019il est commenc\u00e9 t\u00f4t.\n\n\nQuels sont les traitements\u00a0?\n\n\nActuellement, aucun traitement ne permet d\u2019\u00e9liminer compl\u00e8tement le VIH de l\u2019organisme. Les meilleurs d\u2019entre eux permettent aux personnes s\u00e9ropositives de bloquer la multiplication du VIH, et ainsi de garder un syst\u00e8me immunitaire op\u00e9rationnel.\n Ces traitements sont appel\u00e9s trith\u00e9rapies, car ils combinent en une seule prise m\u00e9dicamenteuse les actions de trois inhibiteurs de la multiplication virale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa premi\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d\u2019antir\u00e9troviraux \u00e9tait souvent responsable d\u2019effets secondaires : naus\u00e9es, vomissements, fatigue, perte d\u2019app\u00e9tit, fi\u00e8vres, diarrh\u00e9es, r\u00e9actions cutan\u00e9es...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChez la grande majorit\u00e9 des patients, les m\u00e9dicaments de nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration permettent une vie normale s\u2019ils sont administr\u00e9s pr\u00e9cocement apr\u00e8s l\u2019infection. Des effets secondaires \u00e0 long terme (prise de poids, inflammation...) ne sont toutefois pas \u00e0 exclure. Des recherches et des essais cliniques sont men\u00e9s dans l\u2019objectif de simplifier ces th\u00e9rapies chez les personnes y r\u00e9pondant efficacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa prise d\u2019un traitement antir\u00e9troviral pendant la grossesse\n diminue les risques de transmission \u00e0 moins de 1%, contre 15 \u00e0 30 % sans traitement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPour tous les patients, il est recommand\u00e9 d\u2019initier le traitement au plus t\u00f4t suite \u00e0 l\u2019infection.\n Cela permet de garder le syst\u00e8me immunitaire le plus intact possible tout en limitant le risque de transmission du VIH. C\u2019est ainsi que l\u2019esp\u00e9rance de vie d\u2019une personne s\u00e9ropositive sous traitement peut se rapprocher de celle de la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Malheureusement, la plupart des infections par le VIH ne sont d\u00e9tect\u00e9es qu\u2019apr\u00e8s plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et 60\u202f% seulement des personnes infect\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle mondiale ont acc\u00e8s au traitement.\n\n\nDe rares personnes r\u00e9sistent \u00e0 l\u2019infection\n\n\nUne infime partie des individus vivant avec le VIH (moins de 1%) peuvent maintenir le virus dans leur organisme \u00e0 des niveaux tr\u00e8s faibles, souvent inf\u00e9rieurs au seuil de d\u00e9tection dans le sang. Ce contr\u00f4le spontan\u00e9 est souvent associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un fond g\u00e9n\u00e9tique particulier, \u00e0 l'origine de r\u00e9actions immunitaires tr\u00e8s fortes et sp\u00e9cifiquement dirig\u00e9es contre le VIH.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUne minorit\u00e9 (5 \u00e0 10%) des patients suivis et trait\u00e9s dans les semaines suivant l\u2019infection sont devenues capables de contr\u00f4ler le virus. Ces personnes, appel\u00e9es contr\u00f4leurs post-traitement, sont en \u00e9tat de r\u00e9mission du VIH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDe tr\u00e8s rares personnes sont m\u00eame capables de r\u00e9sister directement \u00e0 l\u2019infection. Cette capacit\u00e9 leur vient d\u2019une mutation qui affecte un r\u00e9cepteur situ\u00e9 \u00e0 la surface de certains lymphocytes, que le VIH peut en temps normal utiliser pour les infecter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPar ailleurs, des personnes qui pr\u00e9sentent des risques importants d\u2019exposition mais restent s\u00e9ron\u00e9gatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crites, sans qu\u2019on puisse l\u2019expliquer.\n\n\nComment pr\u00e9venir la maladie\u00a0?\n\n\nLa pr\u00e9vention passe en premier lieu par des mesures emp\u00eachant la transmission du VIH. Par exemple l\u2019usage du pr\u00e9servatif, ou encore de mat\u00e9riel injectable \u00e0 usage unique...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActuellement, il n\u2019existe aucun vaccin efficace contre le VIH.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa prophylaxie pr\u00e9-exposition (ou PrEP)\n est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 certaines personnes \u00e0 risque de contamination. Elle d\u00e9signe la prescription d\u2019un m\u00e9dicament de pr\u00e9vention de l\u2019infection par le VIH. Tr\u00e8s efficace si suivie avec rigueur, la PrEP r\u00e9duit d\u2019environ 99 % le risque de contracter le VIH lors de rapports sexuels, et d\u2019au moins 74 % celui de le contracter lors d\u2019un partage de seringue.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUn traitement antir\u00e9troviral post-exposition\n suivi avec rigueur, apr\u00e8s un comportement \u00e0 risque, rend le virus ind\u00e9tectable dans le sang, ce qui diminue consid\u00e9rablement le risque de transmission.\n\n\nCombien de personnes touch\u00e9es\u00a0?\n\n\nLe site officiel de l\u2019Organisation mondiale de la sant\u00e9 (OMS) publie r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des mises \u00e0 jour sur l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de l\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mie de VIH : nombre de personnes s\u00e9ropositives, nombre de d\u00e9c\u00e8s...\u00a0\nVoir les principaux rep\u00e8res sur le\u00a0VIH et le sida sur le site de l'OMS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40 ans apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte du VIH\n\n\n\n\nLire le dossier de presse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuillet 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContenus li\u00e9s\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument de presse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.01.2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIH : le traitement pr\u00e9coce, cl\u00e9 de la r\u00e9mission\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLes personnes vivant avec le VIH doivent prendre un traitement antir\u00e9troviral \u00e0 vie pour emp\u00eacher la multiplication du virus dans l\u2019organisme...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEn savoir plus\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument de presse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.07.2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsida\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\u00e9mission de l\u2019infection par le VIH-1 : d\u00e9couverte d\u2019anticorps neutralisants \u00e0 large spectre impliqu\u00e9s dans le contr\u00f4le du virus\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertains individus porteurs du VIH-1 et ayant b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019un traitement antir\u00e9troviral pr\u00e9coce pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es ont la capacit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4ler...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEn savoir plus\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument de presse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.07.2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsida\n, \nSida/VIH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIH : 20 mois de r\u00e9mission apr\u00e8s greffe de moelle osseuse en absence de mutation protectrice \u2013 le patient de Gen\u00e8ve\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn f\u00e9vrier dernier, le consortium IciStem, dont fait partie l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n \u00e0 l\u2019Institut Pasteur, publiait dans la revue Nature Medicine...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEn savoir plus\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25-28 Rue du Dr Roux, 75015 Paris\n\n\n01 45 68 80 00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL'Institut Pasteur\n\n\nNos missions\n\n\nNous soutenir\n\n\nCentre m\u00e9dical\n\n\nLe journal de la recherche\n\n\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaites un don\n\n\nEspace presse\n\n\nCeRIS\n\n\nMentions l\u00e9gales\n\n\nCredits\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuivre l'Institut Pasteur sur Facebook\n\n\nSuivre l'Institut Pasteur sur LinkedIn\n\n\nSuivre l'Institut Pasteur sur Twitter\n\n\nSuivre l'Institut Pasteur sur Youtube\n\n\nSuivre l'Institut Pasteur sur Instagram\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetour en haut"

It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.\nIf left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n).\nThe human body can\u2019t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life.\n\r\nLuckily, however, effective treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is available. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (also called the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral suppression. If a person\u2019s viral load is so low that a standard lab can\u2019t detect it, this is called having an undetectable viral load. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can \nlive long and healthy lives\n and \nwill not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex\n.\nIn addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including \npre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)\n, medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use, and \npost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\n, HIV medicine taken within 72 hours after a possible exposure to prevent the virus from taking hold. \nLearn about other ways to prevent getting or transmitting HIV\n.\nWhat Is AIDS?\nAIDS is the late \nstage of HIV infection\n that occurs when the body\u2019s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.\nIn the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because taking \nHIV medicine\n as prescribed stops the progression of the disease.\nA person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when:\nthe number of their CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm3). (In someone with a healthy immune system, CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.) OR\nthey develop one or more \nopportunistic infections\n regardless of their CD4 count.\nWithout HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving. But people who start HIV medicine soon after they get HIV experience more benefits\u2014that\u2019s why HIV testing is so important.\nHow Do I Know If I Have HIV?\nThe only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested\n. Testing is relatively simple. You can ask your health care provider for an HIV test. Many medical clinics, substance abuse programs, community health centers, and hospitals offer them too. If you test positive, you can be connected to HIV care to start treatment as soon as possible. If you test negative, you have the information you need to take steps to \nprevent getting HIV\n in the future.\nTo find an HIV testing location near you, use the \nHIV Services Locator\n.\nHIV self-testing is also an option.\n Self-testing allows people to take an HIV test and find out their result in their own home or other private location. With an HIV self-test, you can get your test results within 20 minutes. You can buy an HIV self-test kit at a pharmacy or online. Some health departments or community-based organizations also provide HIV self-test kits for a reduced cost or for free. You can call your local health department or use the \nHIV Testing and Care Services Locator\n to find organizations that offer HIV self-test kits near you. (Contact the organization for eligibility requirements.)\nNote:\n State laws regarding self-testing vary and may limit availability. Check with a health care provider or \nhealth department\nExit Disclaimer\n for additional testing options.\nLearn more about HIV self-testing and which test might be right for you\n.\nRelated HIV.gov Blogs\nDec 18, 2024\nLibrary of Congress and National AIDS Memorial Make AIDS Memorial Quilt Available to All\n2 min read\nListen\n(1)\nWatch\n(1)\nDownload\n(, )\nDec 3, 2024\nWorld AIDS Day 2024 Roundup: Key Messages and Resources from the White House and Federal Agencies\n6 min read\nListen\n(1)\nWatch\n(1)\nDownload\n(, )\nDec 2, 2024\nWorld AIDS Day: PEPFAR\u2019s 2024 Accomplishments\n2 min read\nListen\n(1)\nWatch\n(1)\nDownload\n(, )\nTOPICS & ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nTopics\nHIV Testing Day\nNational HIV Testing Day\nWorld AIDS Day\nAdditional Resources\n\n\nHIVinfo.NIH.gov \u2013 \n HIV and AIDS: The Basics\n\n\nCDC \u2013 \nHIV Basics\n\n\nNIH \u2013 \nHIV/AIDS\n\n\nOWH \u2013 \nHIV and AIDS Basics\n\n\nVA \u2013 \nHIV/AIDS Basics\n\n\n\n\nUp Next\nAbout HIV & AIDS\nHow Is HIV Transmitted?\nSearch\nFind HIV Testing Sites & Care Services\nConnect With Us\nFacebook\nX\nYoutube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nSubscribe\nHIV.gov Mission & Team\nLocator Widgets\n \nBlog Archives\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\n \nDisclaimers\nNondiscrimination Notice\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\nFreedom of Information Act\nPlayers & Viewers\nHHS Privacy Policy\nUSA.gov\nHHS.gov\nHHS 508\nWhite House\nEspa\u00f1ol\n (Spanish)\n\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\n (Chinese)\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\n (Vietnamese)\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n (Korean)\nTagalog\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n (Russian)\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n (Arabic)\nKrey\u00f2l Ayisyen\n (Haitian Creole)\nFran\u00e7ais\n (French)\nPolski\n (Polish)\nPortugu\u00eas\n (Portuguese)\nItaliano\n (Italian)\nDeutsch\n (German)\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n (Farsi)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n (Japanese)\nHIV.gov\nEnding the HIV Epidemic\n \nAmerica\u2019s HIV Epidemic Analysis Dashboard\nLocator HIV.gov\nClinical Info\n \nPositive Spin\nChatbot\nThis is an official U.S. Government website managed by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and supported by the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund."

Symptoms may last for a few days or several weeks. \n\n\nHaving these symptoms alone doesn't mean you have HIV. Other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. \n\n\nSome people have \nno symptoms\n at all.

These fluids include:\n\n\n\n\nblood,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemen (\ncum\n),\n\n\n\n\n\n\npre-seminal fluid (\npre-cum\n),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrectal fluids,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvaginal fluids, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbreast milk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese fluids must come in contact with a \nmucous membrane\n or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to occur. \n\n\nFactors like a person's viral load, other sexually transmitted infections, and alcohol or drug use can increase the chances of getting or transmitting HIV. \n\n\nBut there are powerful tools that can help \nprevent HIV transmission\n.\n\n\nKeep Reading:\n\n\nHow HIV Spreads\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention\n\n\nToday, more tools than ever are available to prevent HIV. \n\n\nPrevention strategies include:\n\n\n\n\nUsing condoms the right way every time you have sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nPrEP\n (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and \nPEP\n (post-exposure prophylaxis).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have HIV, there are many ways to prevent transmitting HIV to others, including taking \nHIV treatment\n to get and keep an undetectable viral load.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to prevent HIV.\n\n\nKeep Reading:\n\n\nPreventing HIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nThe only way to know your HIV status is to get tested. Knowing your status gives you powerful information to keep you and your partner(s) healthy.\n\n\nThere are many options for quick, free, and painless HIV testing. If your \ntest result is positive\n, you can take medicine to \ntreat HIV\n to help you live a long, healthy life and protect others. If your \ntest result is negative\n, you can take actions to \nprevent HIV\n.\n\n\n\n\nGet tested for HIV\u200e\n\n\nCDC recommends \neveryone\n between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV \nat least once\n.

You should start HIV treatment \nas soon as possible\n after diagnosis. \n\n\nHIV treatment reduces the amount of HIV in the blood (\nviral load\n). HIV treatment can make the viral load so low that a test can't detect it (\nundetectable viral load\n). If you have an undetectable viral load, you will not transmit HIV to others through sex. Having an undetectable viral load also reduces the risk of HIV transmission through sharing drug injection equipment, and during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.\n\n\n\n\nGetting and keeping an undetectable viral load is the best thing you can do to stay healthy.\n\n\nKeep Reading:\n\n\nTreating HIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it progresses\n\n\nWhen people with HIV don't get treatment, they typically progress through three stages. But \nHIV treatment\n can slow or prevent progression of the disease. With advances in HIV treatment, progression to Stage 3 (AIDS) is less common today.\n\n\nStage 1: Acute HIV Infection\n\n\n\n\nPeople have a large amount of HIV in their blood and are very contagious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people have flu-like symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have flu-like symptoms and think you may have been exposed to HIV, \nget tested\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 2: Chronic HIV Infection\n\n\n\n\nThis stage is also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV is still active and continues to reproduce in the body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople may not have any symptoms or get sick during this phase but can transmit HIV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who take HIV treatment as prescribed may never move into Stage 3 (AIDS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout HIV treatment, this stage may last a decade or longer, or may progress faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of this stage, the amount of HIV in the blood (\nviral load\n) goes up and the person may move into Stage 3 (AIDS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 3: Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)\n\n\n\n\nThe most severe stage of HIV infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople receive an AIDS diagnosis when their CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells per milliliter of blood, or they develop certain illnesses (sometimes called opportunistic infections).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople with AIDS can have a high viral load and may easily transmit HIV to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople with AIDS have damaged immune systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can get an increasing number of other serious illnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nHIV 101\n\n\nThis info sheet provides basic information about HIV.\n\n\nMar. 17, 2024\n\n\n \nDownload\n\n\n \nDownload\n\n\nHIV and AIDS Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\tOn This Page\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nSymptoms\n\n\nHow it spreads\n\n\nPrevention\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nHow it progresses\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tNovember 4, 2024\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyndicate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Source:\n\n\nNational Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention\n; \nDivision of HIV Prevention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHIV\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about HIV and how the virus is transmitted, how to protect yourself and others, and how to live well with HIV.

If enough CD4 cells are infected and damaged, your body cannot fight off certain germs, which can lead to infection and illness.\n\n\nAIDS stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It is when a person's immune system has been badly damaged by the HIV virus and their body has become too weak to fight off many infections. This is the last stage of HIV infection. A person with AIDS can develop infections and illnesses that are life-threatening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Spread of HIV\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV infection is passed on through body fluids such as:\n\n\n\n\nblood\n\n\nsemen\n\n\nrectal and vaginal fluids\n\n\nbreast milk.\n\n\n\n\nSaliva, sweat and urine do not carry enough of the virus to infect another person. So HIV cannot be passed on through kissing or touching an infected person.\n\n\nIf an infected person has been on medication and has had an\n\u00a0\nundetectable viral load\n\u00a0\nfor at least 6 months, they cannot pass on HIV either.

HIV is a retrovirus that infects cells of the human immune system (mainly CD4-positive T-cells and macrophages\u2014key components of the cellular immune system) and destroys or impairs their function. Infection with this virus results in the progressive depletion of the immune system, leading to immunodeficiency.\n\n\nThe immune system is considered deficient when it can no longer fulfil its role of fighting off infection and diseases. People with immunodeficiency are much more vulnerable to a wide range of infections and cancers, most of which are rare among people without immunodeficiency. Diseases associated with severe immunodeficiency are known as opportunistic infections because they take advantage of a weakened immune system.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2) What is AIDS?\n\n\nAIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and describes the collection of symptoms and infections associated with acquired deficiency of the immune system. Infection with HIV has been established as the underlying cause of AIDS. The level of immunodeficiency or the appearance of certain infections are used as indicators that HIV infection has progressed to AIDS \n(see question 4)\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3) What are the symptoms of HIV?\n\n\nMost people infected with HIV do not know that they have become infected. Immediately after the infection, some people have a glandular fever-like illness (with fever, rash, joint pains and enlarged lymph nodes), which can occur at the time of seroconversion. Seroconversion refers to the development of antibodies to HIV and usually takes place between one and two months after an infection has occurred \n(\nsee question 32)\n.\n\n\nDespite the fact that HIV infection often does not cause any symptoms, a person newly infected with HIV is infectious and can transmit the virus to another person \n(\nsee question 7)\n. The way to determine whether HIV infection has occurred is by taking an HIV test \n(see question 31)\n.\n\n\nHIV infection causes a gradual depletion and weakening of the immune system. This results in an increased susceptibility of the body to infections and cancers and can lead to the development of AIDS (\nsee questions \n2\n and \n4\n)\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4) When does a person have AIDS?\n\n\nThe term AIDS applies to the most advanced stages of HIV infection.\n\n\nThe majority of people infected with HIV, if not treated, develop signs of AIDS within eight to 10 years.\n\n\nAIDS is identified on the basis of certain infections. Stage 1 HIV disease is asymptomatic and not categorized as AIDS. Stage II (includes minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections), III (includes unexplained chronic diarrhoea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis) or IV (includes toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the oesophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma) HIV disease are used as indicators of AIDS. Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that can be treated easily in healthy people.\n\n\nIn addition, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines AIDS on the basis of a CD4-positive T-cell count of less than 200 per mm\n3\n of blood (see: \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/print/aids1993.htm\n). CD4-positive T-cells are critical in mounting an effective immune response to infections.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5) How quickly do people infected with HIV develop AIDS?\n\n\nThe length of time can vary widely between individuals. The time between infection with HIV and becoming ill with AIDS can be 10\u201315 years, sometimes longer, but sometimes shorter. Antiretroviral therapy can prevent progression to AIDS by decreasing viral load in an infected body \n(see question 26)\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6) Where is HIV found?\n\n\nHIV can be found in body fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids and breast milk.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7) How can HIV be transmitted?\n\n\nHIV is transmitted through penetrative (anal or vaginal) sex, blood transfusion, the sharing of contaminated needles in health-care settings and drug injection and between mother and infant during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding.\n\n\nSexual transmission\n\n\nHIV can be transmitted through penetrative sex. HIV is not transmitted very efficiently so the risk of infection through a single act of vaginal sex is low. Transmission through anal sex has been reported to be 10 times higher than by vaginal sex. A person with an untreated sexually transmitted infection, particularly involving ulcers or discharge, is, on average, six to 10 times more likely to pass on or acquire HIV during sex.\u00a0\n\n\nOral sex is regarded as a low-risk sexual activity in terms of HIV transmission.\n\n\nWhen a person living with HIV is taking effective antiretroviral therapy and has a suppressed viral load they are no longer infectious.\u00a0\n\n\nTransmission through sharing of needles and syringes\n\n\nRe-using or sharing needles or syringes represents a highly efficient way of transmitting HIV. The risk of transmission can be lowered substantially among people who inject drugs by always using new needles and syringes that are disposable or by properly sterilizing reusable needles/syringes before reuse \n(see question 19)\n. Transmission in a health-care setting can be lowered by health-care workers adhering to universal precautions \n(see question 20)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMother-to-child transmission\n\n\nHIV can be transmitted to an infant during pregnancy, labour, delivery and breastfeeding. Generally, there is a 15\u201330% risk of transmission from mother to child before and during delivery. A number of factors influence the risk of infection, particularly the viral load of the mother at birth (the higher the load, the higher the risk). Transmission from mother to child after birth can also occur through breastfeeding \n(see question 21)\n. The chances of transmission of HIV to a child is very low if the mother is on antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and when breastfeeding.\n\n\nTransmission through blood transfusion\n\n\nThere is a high risk (greater than 90%) of acquiring HIV through transfusion of infected blood and blood products. However, the implementation of blood safety standards ensures the provision of safe, adequate and good-quality blood and blood products for all patients requiring transfusion. Blood safety includes screening of all donated blood for HIV and other blood-borne pathogens, as well as appropriate donor selection.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8) What is the risk of transmitting HIV through kissing or deep kissing?\n\n\nTransmission through kissing on the mouth carries no risk, and no evidence has been found that the virus is spread through saliva by kissing.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9) What is the risk of transmitting HIV through body piercing or tattooing?\n\n\nA risk of HIV transmission does exist if contaminated instruments are either not sterilized or are shared with others. Instruments that are intended to penetrate the skin should be used once, then disposed of or thoroughly cleaned and sterilized.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10) What is the risk of transmitting HIV through sharing razors with an infected person?\n\n\nAny kind of cut using an unsterilized object, such as a razor or knife, can transmit HIV. Sharing razors is not advisable unless they are fully sterilized after each use.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11) Is it safe to have sex with a person living with HIV?\n\n\nHaving sex with someone living with HIV is safe if the person\u2019s virus is fully suppressed by treatment. Sex is also safe if a condom is used properly or if you are taking pre-exposure prophylaxis in accordance with your health-care provider\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12) Is it safe for two people living with HIV to engage in unprotected sex exclusively with each other?\n\n\nIt is best for someone living with HIV to avoid becoming infected with a different strain of the virus. Therefore, the advice given in question 11 should be followed, except for the advice about pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is never used by people living with HIV.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrevention\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13) How can HIV infection be prevented?\n\n\nSexual transmission of HIV can be prevented by:\n\n\n\n\nMonogamous relations between uninfected partners.\n\n\nNon-penetrative sex.\n\n\nConsistent and correct use of male or female condoms\n\n\nSex between two people when one of them is living with HIV but in taking antiretroviral therapy and has undetectable viral load\n\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis taken by people who are not infected with HIV.\n\n\nVoluntary Medical Male Circumcision reduces the chances of men acquiring HIV from women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional ways of avoiding infection:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are an injecting drug user, always use new needles and syringes that are disposable or needles and syringes that have been properly sterilized before reuse \n(see question 20)\n or opt for other prevention measures such as Opioid Substitution therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that blood and blood products are tested for HIV and that blood safety standards are implemented.\n\n\nSee questions 19\u201322\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14) What is safer sex?\n\n\nSafer sex involves taking precautions that decrease the potential of transmitting or acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, while having sex. Using condoms correctly and consistently during sex is considered safer sex, as is oral sex and non-penetrative sex or taking pre exposure prophylaxis if you are at risk of HIV infection or having undetectable viral load if you are living with HIV.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15) How effective are condoms in preventing HIV?\n\n\nQuality-assured condoms are the only products currently available to protect against sexual infection by HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. When used properly, condoms are a proven and effective means of preventing HIV infection among women and men.\n\n\nIn order to achieve the protective effect of condoms, they must be used correctly and consistently. Incorrect use can lead to condom slippage or breakage, thus diminishing their protective effect.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n16) How do you use a male condom?\n\n\n\n\nCondoms with lubrication are less likely to tear during handling or use. Oil-based lubricants, such as Vaseline, should not be used, as they can damage the condom.\n\n\nOnly open the package containing the condom when you are ready to use it. Otherwise, the condom will dry out. Be careful not to tear or damage the condom when you open the package. If it does get torn, throw it away and open a new package.\n\n\nCondoms come rolled up into a flat circle. Place the rolled-up condom, right side up, on the end of the penis. Hold the tip of the condom between your thumb and first finger to squeeze the air out of the tip. This leaves room for the semen to collect after ejaculation. Keep holding the top of the condom with one hand. With the other hand, unroll the condom all the way down the length of the erect penis to the pubic hair.\n\n\nIf the condom is not lubricated enough, a water-based lubricant (such as silicone, glycerin or K-Y jelly) can be added. Lubricants made from oil\u2014cooking oil or shortening, mineral or baby oil, petroleum jellies such as Vaseline and most lotions\u2014should never be used because they can damage the condom.\n\n\n\n\nAfter sex, the condom needs to be removed the right way.\n\n\n\n\nRight after the man ejaculates, he must hold onto the condom at the base, to be sure that the condom does not slip off.\n\n\nThen, the man must pull out while the penis is still erect.\n\n\nWhen the penis is completely withdrawn, remove the condom from the penis and throw away the condom. Do not flush it down the toilet.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are going to have sex again, use a new condom and repeat the whole process.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17) What is a female condom?\n\n\nA female condom is a female-controlled contraceptive barrier method. The female condom is a strong, soft, transparent polyurethane sheath inserted into the vagina before sexual intercourse. It entirely lines the vagina and, therefore, with correct and consistent use, provides protection against both pregnancy and many sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. The female condom has no known side-effects or risks and does not require a prescription or the intervention of a health-care provider.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18) How do you use a female condom?\n\n\n\n\nCarefully remove the condom from its protective pouch. Add extra lubricant, if desired, to the inner and outer rings of the condom.\n\n\nTo insert the condom, squat down, sit with your knees apart or stand with one foot on a stool or low chair. Hold the condom with the open end hanging down. While holding the top ring of the pouch (the closed end of the condom) squeeze the ring between your thumb and middle finger.\n\n\nNow place your index finger between your thumb and middle fingers. With your fingers in this position, keep the top of the condom squeezed in a flat oval. Use your other hand to spread the lips of your vagina and insert the closed end of the pouch.\n\n\nOnce you have inserted the closed end of the pouch, use your index finger to push the pouch the rest of the way up into your vagina. Check to be certain that the top of the pouch is up past your pubic bone, which you can feel by curving your index finger upwards once it is a few inches inside your vagina. You can insert the pouch up to eight hours before your have intercourse.\n\n\nMake sure that the condom is not twisted inside your vagina: if it is, remove it, add a drop or two of lubricant and re-insert. Note: about two centimetres of the open end of the condom will remain outside your body. If your partner inserts his penis underneath or alongside the pouch, ask him to withdraw immediately. Remove the condom, discard it and use a new pouch. Until you and your partner become familiar with the female condom, it will be helpful if you use your hand to guide his penis into your vagina.\n\n\nAfter your partner ejaculates and withdraws, squeeze and twist the open end of the pouch to keep the sperm inside. Pull out gently. Dispose of the used condom (but do not throw it down the toilet).\n\n\nThe re-use of female condoms is not recommended (see \nhttp://www.who.int/reproductive-health/rtis/reuse.en.html\n).\n\n\n\n\nSee also: \nhttp://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/RHR_00_8/RHR_00_8_chapter5.en.html\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n19) What is post-exposure preventive treatment?\n\n\nPost-exposure preventive (PEP) treatment consists of medication, laboratory tests and counselling. PEP treatment must be initiated within hours of possible HIV exposure and must continue for a period of approximately four weeks. Research studies suggest that, if the medication is initiated quickly after possible HIV exposure (ideally within two hours and not later than 72 hours following such exposure), it is beneficial in preventing HIV infection.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n20) How can injecting drug users reduce their risk of contracting HIV?\n\n\nFor injecting drug users, certain steps can be taken to reduce personal and public health risks:\n\n\n\n\nTake drugs orally (change from injecting to non-injecting drug use).\n\n\nNever re-use or share syringes, water or drug-preparation equipment.\n\n\nUse a new syringe (obtained from a reliable source, e.g. a chemist or via a needle\u2013syringe programme) to prepare and inject drugs each time.\n\n\nWhen preparing drugs, use sterile water or clean water from a reliable source.\n\n\nUsing a fresh alcohol swab, clean the injection site prior to injection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21) How can mother-to-child transmission be prevented?\n\n\nTransmission of HIV from a mother living with HIV to her baby can occur during pregnancy, during labour or after delivery through breastfeeding. In the absence of any intervention, an estimated 15\u201330% of mothers living with HIV will transmit the infection during pregnancy and delivery. Breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission by 10\u201315%. This risk depends on clinical factors and may vary according to the pattern and duration of breastfeeding.\n\n\nGreat progress has been made in reducing the number of children born with HIV. The risk of a woman living with HIV passing the virus on to her child can be reduced to 5% or less with effective antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. Primary prevention of new HIV infections among women of childbearing age, coupled with early access to prenatal care and HIV testing, are key to the strategy, with women living with HIV also encouraged to remain on lifelong treatment for their own health (the Option B+ strategy).\n\n\nEarly infant diagnosis is essential to identify the HIV status of infants and to improve prevention and treatment programmes, as peak mortality occurs between six weeks to four months of age for children who have acquired HIV infection.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22) What procedures should health-care workers follow to prevent transmission in health-care settings?\n\n\nHealth-care workers should follow universal precautions. Universal precautions are infection-control guidelines developed to protect health workers and their patients from exposure to diseases spread by blood and certain body fluids.\n\n\nUniversal precautions include:\n\n\n\n\nCareful handling and disposal of \u201csharps\u201d (items that could cause cuts or puncture wounds, including needles, hypodermic needles, scalpels and other blades, knives, infusion sets, saws, broken glass and nails). \u00a0\n\n\nHand-washing with soap and water before and after all procedures.\n\n\nUse of protective barriers, such as gloves, gowns, aprons, masks and goggles, when in direct contact with blood and other body fluids.\n\n\nSafe disposal of waste contaminated with blood or other body fluids.\n\n\nProper disinfection of instruments and other contaminated equipment.\n\n\nProper handling of soiled linen.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, it is recommended that all health-care workers take precautions to prevent injuries caused by needles, scalpels and other sharp instruments or devices. In accordance with universal precautions, blood and other body fluids from all people are considered as infected with HIV and other possible viruses, regardless of the known or supposed status of the person.\n\n\nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.who.int/hiv/topics/precautions/universal/en/\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n23) Is there a cure for HIV?\n\n\nThere is no cure for HIV. However, there is effective treatment, which, if started promptly and taken regularly, results in a quality and length of life for someone living with HIV that is similar to that expected in the absence of infection.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24) What treatment is available?\n\n\nAntiretroviral medicines are used in the treatment of HIV infection. They work against HIV infection by blocking the reproduction of HIV in the body \n(see question 4)\n. \nWhen a person living with HIV is on effective antiretroviral therapy, they are no longer infectious.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n25) How do antiretroviral medicines work?\n\n\nInside an infected cell, HIV produces new copies of itself, which can then go on to infect other healthy cells within the body. The more cells HIV infects, the greater its impact on the immune system (immunodeficiency). Antiretroviral medicines slow down the replication and, therefore, the spread of the virus within the body by interfering with its replication process in different ways.\n\n\nNucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:\n HIV needs an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to generate new copies of itself. This group of medicines inhibits reverse transcriptase by preventing the process that replicates the virus\u2019s genetic material.\n\n\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:\n this group of medicines also interferes with the replication of HIV by binding to the reverse transcriptase enzyme itself. This prevents the enzyme from working and stops the production of new virus particles in the infected cells.\n\n\nProtease inhibitors:\n protease is a digestive enzyme that is needed in the replication of HIV to generate new virus particles. It breaks down proteins and enzymes in the infected cells, which can then go on to infect other cells. The protease inhibitors prevent this breakdown of proteins and therefore slows down the production of new virus particles.\n\n\nOther medicines that inhibit other stages in the virus\u2019s cycle (such as entry of the virus and fusion with an uninfected cell) are currently being tested in clinical trials.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n26) Are antiretroviral medicines effective?\n\n\nThe use of antiretroviral medicines in a combination of three medicines has been shown to dramatically reduce AIDS-related illness and death. While not a cure for AIDS, combination antiretroviral therapy has enabled people living with HIV to live longer, healthier, more productive lives by reducing viraemia (the amount of HIV in the blood) and increasing the number of CD4-positive cells (white blood cells that are central to the effective functioning of the immune system).\u00a0\n\n\nFor antiretroviral treatment to be effective for a long time, different antiretroviral medicines need to be combined. This is what is known as combination therapy. The term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is used to describe a combination of three or more anti-HIV medicines.\n\n\nIf one medicine is taken on its own, it has been found that, over a period of time, changes in the virus enable it to build up resistance to the medicine. The medicine is then no longer effective and the virus starts to reproduce to the same extent as before. If two or more antiretroviral medicines are taken together, the rate at which resistance develops can be reduced substantially.\n\n\nEffective antiretroviral therapy also prevents the transmission of HIV. When a person living with HIV is taking effective antiretroviral therapy and has a suppressed viral load HIV can no longer be transmitted through sex.\u00a0\n\n\nAntiretroviral medicines should only be taken as prescribed by a health-care professional.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTesting\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n27) What is an HIV test?\n\n\nAn HIV test is a test that reveals whether a person has been infected with HIV. Commonly used HIV tests detect the antibodies produced by the immune system in response to HIV, as they are much easier (and cheaper) to detect than the virus itself. Antibodies are produced by the immune system in response to an infection.\n\n\nFor most people, it takes a month for these antibodies to develop. Antibodies can be found in blood or oral fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n28) How long after possible exposure should I wait to be tested for HIV?\n\n\nGenerally, it is recommended that you wait three months after possible exposure before being tested for HIV. Although HIV antibody tests are very sensitive, there is a window period of up to two months, depending on the specific test being used, which is the period between infection with HIV and the appearance of detectable antibodies to the virus. In the case of the most sensitive anti-HIV tests currently recommended, the window period is about three weeks. This period may be longer if less-sensitive tests are used.\n\n\nDuring the window period, people infected with HIV have no antibodies in their blood that can be detected by an HIV test. However, the person may already have high levels of HIV in their body fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids and breast milk. HIV can be passed on to another person during the window period even though an HIV test may not show that they are infected with HIV.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n29) Why should I get an HIV test?\n\n\nKnowing your HIV status has two vital benefits. Firstly, if you are HIV-infected, you can start treatment promptly, thereby potentially prolonging your life for many years \n(see question 36)\n. Secondly, if you know you are infected, you can take all the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of HIV to others \n(see question 13)\n. If you are not infected with HIV, you can learn how to protect yourself from HIV in the future\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n30) Where can I get tested?\n\n\nThere are many places where you can be tested for HIV: in the offices of a private doctor, a local health department, hospitals, family planning clinics and sites specifically set up for HIV testing. Always try to find testing at a place where counselling is provided about HIV. \u00a0You can also take an HIV test in privacy by using an HIV self-test kit. However you should go and see your health-care provider in the event of a positive test result for confirmation and seeking appropriate treatment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31) Are my test results confidential?\n\n\nAll people taking an HIV test must give informed consent prior to being tested. The results of the test must be kept absolutely confidential.\n\n\nThere are different types of testing available:\n\n\nConfidential HIV test:\n the medical professionals handling the HIV test keep the result of the test confidential within the medical records. Results cannot be shared with another individual unless written permission is provided by the person tested.\n\n\nAnonymous HIV test:\n the tested person\u2019s name is not used in connection with the test. Instead, a code or number is assigned to the test, which allows the individual being tested to receive the results of the test. No records are kept that would link the person to the test.\n\n\nShared confidentiality is encouraged and refers to confidentiality that is shared with others, who might include family members, loved ones, caregivers and trusted friends. However, care should be taken when revealing the results as it can lead to discrimination in health-care and professional and social settings. Shared confidentiality is therefore at the discretion of the person who will be tested. Although the result of the HIV test should be kept confidential, other professionals, such as counsellors and health and social service workers, might also need to be aware of the person\u2019s HIV-positive status in order to provide appropriate care.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32) What do I do if I have HIV?\n\n\nThanks to new treatments, people living with HIV can now live long, healthy lives. It is very important to make sure you have a doctor who knows how to treat HIV. A health-care professional or trained HIV counsellor can provide counselling and help you to find an appropriate doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n33) What does it mean if I test negative for HIV?\n\n\nA negative test result means that no HIV antibodies were found in your blood at the time of testing. If you are negative, make sure you stay that way: learn the facts about HIV transmission and avoid engaging in unsafe behaviour.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, there is still a possibility of being infected, since it can take up to three months for your immune system to produce enough antibodies to show infection in a blood test. It is advisable to be retested at a later date and to take appropriate precautions in the meantime. During the window period, a person is highly infectious, and should therefore take measures to prevent any possible transmission.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMyths\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n34) Are mosquito bites a risk of infection with HIV?\n\n\nHIV is not spread by mosquitoes or other biting insects. Even if the virus enters a mosquito or another sucking or biting insect, it cannot reproduce in the insect. Since the insect cannot be infected with HIV, it cannot transmit HIV to the next human it feeds on or bites.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n35) Should I be concerned about being infected with HIV while playing a sport?\n\n\nThere is no evidence that HIV can be transmitted while playing a sport.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n36) Can I get HIV from casual contact (shaking hands, hugging, using a toilet, drinking from the same glass as someone who is living with HIV or being close to an infected person who is sneezing or coughing)?\n\n\nHIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in social settings, schools or the workplace. You cannot be infected by shaking someone\u2019s hand, by hugging someone, by using the same toilet or drinking from the same glass as someone living with HIV or by being exposed to coughing or sneezing by an infected person \n(see question 7)\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37) Does HIV only affect homosexuals and drug users?\n\n\nNo. Anyone who has condom-less sex, shares injecting equipment or has a transfusion with contaminated blood can become infected with HIV. Infants can be infected with HIV from their mothers during pregnancy, during labour or after delivery through breastfeeding.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n38) Can you tell if someone has HIV just by looking at them?\n\n\nYou cannot tell if someone has HIV by just looking at them. A person infected with HIV may look healthy and feel good, but they can still pass the virus to you. An HIV test is the only way a person can find out if he or she is infected with HIV.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n39) Can I have more than one sexually transmitted infection at a time?\n\n\nYes, you can have more than one sexually transmitted infection at the same time. Each infection requires its own treatment. You cannot become immune to sexually transmitted infections. You can catch the same infection over and over again. Many men and women do not see or feel any early symptoms when they first become infected with a sexually transmitted infection; however, they can still infect their sexual partner.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n40) When you are on antiretroviral therapy, can you transmit HIV to others?\n\n\nIf the antiretroviral therapy is effective and the virus is fully suppressed, you cannot transmit HIV to others. For this reason, monitoring of the suppression of the viral load is recommended as part of ongoing care for people living with HIV.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHIV and COVID-19\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n41) I\u2019m living with HIV. What should I know about COVID-19?\n\n\nCOVID-19 is a serious disease and all people living with HIV should take all recommended preventive measures to minimize exposure to, and prevent infection by, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\nAs in the general population, older people living with HIV or people living with HIV with heart or lung problems may be at a higher risk of becoming infected with the virus and of suffering more serious symptoms.\n\n\nWe will actively learn more about how HIV and COVID-19 together impact on people living with HIV from countries and communities responding to both epidemics. Lessons in rolling out innovations or adapting service delivery to minimize the impact on people living with HIV will be shared and replicated as they become available. Until more is known, people living with HIV\u2014especially those with advanced or poorly controlled HIV disease\u2014should be cautious and pay attention to the prevention measures and recommendations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n42) How should people living with HIV protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19?\n\n\nPeople living with HIV should protect themselves and others from the virus that causes COVID-19 in the same way that all people are advised to reduce exposure:\n\n\n\n\nRegular and thorough hand washing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.\n\n\nMaintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.\n\n\nMake sure that you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene\u2014cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze and dispose of the used tissue immediately.\n\n\nFollow local health service advice on social distancing measures regarding staying at home except for essential business, health needs and exercise.\n\n\nAvoid gatherings of more than a few people.\n\n\nStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.\n\n\n\n\nUNAIDS recognizes, however, that in many countries, owing to weaker health-care systems, informal settlements, overcrowded cities and public transportation and a lack of clean water and sanitation, the current approaches to self-protection, social distancing and containment may not be viable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n43) Does UNAIDS have any specific recommendations for people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\n\n\nUNAIDS recommends that people living with HIV should have a supply of necessary medical supplies on hand\u2014ideally for 30 days or more. This includes both antiretroviral therapy and other regular medicines, such as tuberculosis treatment, contraceptives and other ongoing treatment for noncommunicable diseases and mental health.\n\n\nThe World Health Organization HIV treatment guidelines now recommend multimonth dispensing of three months or more of HIV medicines for most people at routine visits. Although this has not yet been widely implemented in all countries, UNAIDS calls on all countries to provide such multimonth dispensing.\n\n\nKnow how to contact your clinic by telephone in the event that you need advice. Know how to access treatment and other support within your community. This treatment could include antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis medication (if on tuberculosis treatment) and any other medication for other illnesses that you may have.\n\n\nRemember that other illnesses continue despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Do not hesitate to seek medical advice for new or worsening symptoms, sexual and reproductive health services, mental health challenges or injuries. The risks of poor or inadequate medical treatment are usually greater than the risks of contracting COVID-19 in a health centre.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n44) How should key populations protect themselves against HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\nKey populations, including people who use drugs, sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, transgender people and prisoners, should continue to ensure that they have essential means to prevent HIV infection, such as sterile needles and syringes and/or opioid substitution therapy, condoms and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n45) How do we ensure that human rights are respected and reduce stigma and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\nUNAIDS urges all countries to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption and respecting human rights.\n\n\nUNAIDS and partners are working to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure that HIV-related services continue without disruption.\n\n\nIn the light of overcrowding in many prisons and other places of detention, which undermines hygiene, health, safety and human dignity, a health response alone to COVID-19 in closed settings alone is insufficient. UNAIDS urges political leaders to ensure that COVID-19 preparedness and responses in closed settings are identified and implemented in line with fundamental human rights.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n46) What should I do if I am worried about gender-based violence during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\nIf you are experiencing violence, it may be helpful to reach out to family, friends and neighbours, to seek support from a hotline or, if safe, from an online service for survivors of violence. Find out if local services (e.g. shelters, counselling) are open and reach out to them if available.\n\n\nMake a safety plan in case the violence against you or your children escalates. This includes:\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying a neighbour, friend, relative, colleague or shelter to go to in case you need to leave the house immediately for safety.\n\n\nHave a plan for how you will exit the house safely and how you will reach there (e.g. transport).\u00a0\n\n\nKeep a few essential items (e.g. identification documents, phone, money, medicines, and clothes) available, and a list of telephone numbers in case of an emergency.\u00a0\n\n\nIf possible, develop a code with a trusted neighbour so they can come to your aid in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n47) What should I do if I am concerned about my mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\nPay particular attention to your mental health by:\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding excessive exposure to media coverage of COVID-19. Only read information from trusted sources.\n\n\nTaking care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep and, where possible, avoid alcohol and drugs.\n\n\nMaking time to unwind and reminding yourself that negative feelings will fade.

If HIV is controlled, the risk of transmission is close to zero.\n\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART)\n is the use of HIV medicines that reduce the level of HIV in the blood (called viral load). ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART cannot cure HIV infection, but HIV medicines help people with HIV have about the same life expectancy as people without HIV.\n\n\nHIV medicines (ART) can eliminate the risk of\u00a0HIV \ntransmission\n. For parents with HIV that want to breastfeed, the risk of transmitting HIV through breast milk is less than 1% with the consistent use of HIV medicine (ART) and an undetectable viral load.\n\n\nPeople on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV \ntreatment regimen\n) every day (pills) or by schedule (injections). In many cases oral medicines may be combined into a single pill or capsule. There are newer long-acting medicines given by an injection every 2 months that may be used in some people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is HIV and AIDS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV stands for \nhuman immunodeficiency virus\n, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. The abbreviation \u201cHIV\u201d can refer to the virus or to HIV infection.\n\n\nAIDS\u00a0stands for \nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection.\n\n\nHIV attacks and destroys the infection-fighting\u00a0CD4 cells\u00a0(\nCD4 T lymphocyte\n) of the\u00a0\nimmune system\n. The loss of CD4 cells makes it difficult for the body to fight off infections, illnesses, and certain cancers. Without treatment, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system, causing health decline and the onset of AIDS. With treatment, the immune system can recover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is HIV transmitted?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV can be transmitted from one person to another when certain bodily fluids are shared between people. Bodily fluids that can transmit HIV include blood, semen (\u201ccum\u201d), pre-seminal fluid (\u201cpre-cum\u201d), vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breastmilk. HIV can be transmitted during vaginal or anal sex, through sharing needles for injecting drugs or tattooing, by getting stuck with a needle that has the blood of someone with HIV on it, through pregnancy, and through breastfeeding.\n\n\nThe transmission of HIV from a birthing parent with HIV to their child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding is called \nperinatal transmission\n of HIV. For more information on perinatal transmission, read the HIVinfo fact sheet on\u00a0\nPreventing Perinatal Transmission of HIV\n.\n\n\nYou cannot get HIV by shaking hands or hugging a person who has HIV. You also cannot get HIV from contact with objects, such as dishes, toilet seats, or doorknobs, used by a person with HIV. HIV is not spread through the air or water or by mosquitoes, ticks, or other insects. Use the HIVinfo \nYou Can Safely Share\u2026With Someone With HIV\n\u00a0infographic to spread this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the treatment for HIV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART)\n is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an\u00a0HIV \ntreatment regimen\n) every day (pills) or by schedule (injections). In many cases oral medicines may be combined into a single pill or capsule. There are newer long-acting medicines given by an injection every 2 months that may be used in some people.\n\n\nART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART prevents HIV from multiplying, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body (called the\u00a0\nviral load\n). Having less HIV in the body protects the immune system and prevents HIV infection from advancing to AIDS. ART cannot cure HIV, but HIV medicines can help people with HIV live long, healthy lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can a person reduce the risk of transmitting HIV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nART reduces the risk of HIV transmission. ART can reduce a person\u2019s viral load to an undetectable level. An\u00a0\nundetectable viral load\n\u00a0means that the level of HIV in the blood is too low to be detected by a \nviral load test\n. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex.\n\n\nHIV medicines taken during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding can also reduce the risk of perinatal (parent to infant) transmission of HIV. Previously, replacement feeding (properly prepared formula or pasteurized donor human milk from a milk bank) was recommended instead of breastfeeding since the risk of HIV transmission was considered high. Now, there is evidence that the risk of transmission through the breastmilk of someone consistently using ART and maintaining an undetectable viral load is low (less than 1%). Pregnant people with HIV can speak with their health care provider to determine what method of feeding their baby is right for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can a person reduce the risk of getting HIV?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor people without HIV, there are several ways to reduce the risk of acquiring (getting) HIV infection.\u00a0 Using condoms correctly with every sexual encounter, particularly with partners that are HIV positive with a detectable viral load or with partners whose HIV status is unknown, can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. Reducing HIV risk also involves limiting and reducing sexual partners, and avoiding sharing needles.\nPersons who do not have HIV should talk to their health care provider about \npre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)\n. PrEP is an HIV prevention option for people who do not have HIV but who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day or a long-acting injection. For more information, read the HIVinfo\u00a0fact sheet on \nPre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n.\nPersons who do not have HIV, but may have been exposed to HIV, should talk to their health care provider about \npost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\n within 72 hours after a possible exposure. For more information, read the HIVinfo fact sheet on \nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)\n.\u00a0\nTo learn more about reducing the risk of HIV transmission, read the HIVinfo fact sheet \nThe Basics of HIV Prevention\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV and AIDS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, some people may have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, or rash. The symptoms may last for a few days to several weeks. Other possible symptoms of HIV include night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and mouth ulcers. Having these symptoms does not mean you have HIV. Other illnesses can cause the same symptoms. Some people may not feel sick during early HIV infection (called \nacute HIV\n). During this earliest stage of HIV infection, the virus multiplies rapidly. After the initial stage of infection, HIV continues to multiply but at lower levels.\n\n\nMore severe symptoms of HIV infection for persons not on ART may not appear for many years until HIV has developed into AIDS. People with AIDS have weakened immune systems that make them prone to opportunistic infections. \nOpportunistic infections\n are infections and infection-related cancers that occur more frequently or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems than in people with healthy immune systems.\n\n\nWithout treatment, HIV transmission is possible at any stage of HIV infection\u2014even if a person with HIV has no symptoms of HIV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is AIDS diagnosed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms such as fever, weakness, and weight loss may be a sign that a person\u2019s HIV has advanced to AIDS. However, a diagnosis of AIDS is based on the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\nA drop in \nCD4 count\n to less than 200 cells/mm\n3\n. A CD4 count measures the number of CD4 cells (\nCD4 T lymphocyte\n) in a sample of blood.\n\n\n\n\nOR\n\n\nThe presence of certain opportunistic infections.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough an AIDS diagnosis indicates severe damage to the immune system, HIV medicines can still help people at this stage of HIV infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis fact sheet is based on information from the following sources:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nAbout HIV\nAIDS and Opportunistic Infections\nFrom the NIH Office of AIDS Research:\nGuidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection:\u00a0\nIntroduction\nRecommendations for the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States\nInfant Feeding for Individuals with HIV in the United States\nFrom the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID):\nHIV/AIDS\nAlso see the\u00a0\nHIV Source\n\u00a0collection of HIV links and resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout HIVinfo.NIH.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding HIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact HIVinfo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreedom of Information Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHHS Vulnerability Disclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinicalinfo.HIV.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIH.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOIG.HHS.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitor Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Policies and Notices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Fear Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided in collaboration with NIH\u2019s Office of AIDS Research."

Treatment with antiretroviral drugs can typically prevent AIDS from developing in people with HIV.\nWhat is HIV?\nHIV is a virus that damages the immune system. Untreated HIV affects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cell. \nOver time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of conditions and cancers.\nHIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:\nblood\nsemen\nvaginal and rectal fluids\nbreast milk\nThe virus isn\u2019t transferred in air or water, or through casual contact.\nBecause HIV inserts itself into the DNA of cells, it\u2019s a lifelong condition and currently there\u2019s no drug that eliminates HIV from the body, although many scientists are working to find one. \nHowever, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it\u2019s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.\nWithout treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, known as AIDS. \nAt that point, the immune system is too weak to successfully respond against other diseases, infections, and conditions. \nUntreated, life expectancy with end stage AIDS is about \n3 years\n. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-managed, and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.\nIt\u2019s estimated that \n1.2 million\n Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 7 don\u2019t know they have the virus.\nHIV can cause changes throughout the body. \nLearn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body.\nWhat is AIDS?\nAIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It\u2019s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn\u2019t mean AIDS will develop.\nHIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of \n500 to 1,\n6\n00\n per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below \n200\n per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.\nA person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an \nopportunistic infection\n or cancer that\u2019s rare in people who don\u2019t have HIV. \nAn opportunistic infection such as \nPneumocystis jiroveci\n pneumonia is one that only occurs in a severely immunocompromised person, such as someone with advanced HIV infection (AIDS).\nUntreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There\u2019s currently no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about \n3 years\n. \nThis may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.\nIf AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised, that is, weakened to the point where it can no longer successfully respond against most diseases and infections. \nThat makes the person living with AIDS vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:\npneumonia\ntuberculosis\noral thrush\n, a fungal condition in the mouth or throat\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus\ncryptococcal meningitis\n, a fungal condition in the brain\ntoxoplasmosis\n, a brain condition caused by a parasite\ncryptosporidiosis\n, a condition caused by an intestinal parasite\ncancer, including \nKaposi sarcoma (KS)\n and \nlymphoma\nThe shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn\u2019t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it\u2019s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS. \nLearn more about possible complications that can arise from HIV and AIDS.\nEarly symptoms of HIV\nThe first few weeks after someone contracts HIV is called the \nacute infection stage\n. \nDuring this time, the virus reproduces rapidly. The person\u2019s immune system responds by producing HIV antibodies, which are proteins that take measures to respond against infection.\nDuring this stage, some people have no symptoms at first. However, many people experience symptoms in the first month or so after contracting the virus, but they often don\u2019t realize HIV causes those symptoms. \nThis is because symptoms of the acute stage can be very similar to those of the flu or other seasonal viruses, such as:\nthey may be mild to severe \nthey may come and go \nthey may last anywhere from a few days to several weeks\nEarly symptoms of HIV can include:\nfever\nchills\nswollen lymph nodes\ngeneral aches and pains\nskin rash\nsore throat\nheadache\nnausea\nupset stomach\nBecause these symptoms are similar to common illnesses like the flu, the person who has them might not think they need to see a healthcare provider. \nAnd even if they do, their healthcare provider might suspect the \nflu\n or \nmononucleosis\n and might not even consider HIV.\nWhether a person has symptoms or not, during this period their \nviral load\n is very high. The viral load is the amount of HIV found in the bloodstream. \nA high viral load means that HIV can be easily transmitted to someone else during this time.\nInitial HIV symptoms usually resolve within a few months as the person enters the chronic, or clinical latency, stage of HIV. This stage can last many years or even decades with treatment.\nHIV symptoms can vary from person to person. \nLearn more about the early symptoms of HIV.\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?\nAfter the first month or so, HIV enters the clinical latency stage. This stage can last from a few years to a few decades. \nSome people don\u2019t have any symptoms during this time, while others may have minimal or nonspecific symptoms. A nonspecific symptom is a symptom that doesn\u2019t pertain to one specific disease or condition.\nThese nonspecific symptoms may include:\nheadaches and other aches and pains\nswollen lymph nodes\nrecurrent fevers\nnight sweats\nfatigue\nnausea\nvomiting\ndiarrhea\nweight loss\nskin rashes\nrecurrent oral or vaginal yeast infections\npneumonia\nshingles\nAs with the early stage, HIV is still transferable during this time even without symptoms and can be transmitted to another person. \nHowever, a person won\u2019t know they have HIV unless they get tested. If someone has these symptoms and thinks they may have been exposed to HIV, it\u2019s important that they get tested.\nHIV symptoms at this stage may come and go, or they may progress rapidly. This progression can be slowed substantially with treatment. \nWith the consistent use of this antiretroviral therapy, chronic HIV can last for decades and will likely not develop into AIDS, if treatment was started early enough. \nLearn more about how HIV symptoms can progress over time.\nIs rash a symptom of HIV?\nMany people with HIV experience changes to their skin. Rash is often one of the first symptoms of an HIV infection. Generally, an HIV rash appears as multiple small red lesions that are flat and raised.\nRash related to HIV\nHIV makes someone more susceptible to skin problems because the virus destroys immune system cells that take measures against infection. Co-infections that can cause rash include:\nmolluscum contagiosum\nherpes simplex\nshingles\nThe cause of the rash determines:\nhow it looks \nhow long it lasts\nhow it can be treated depends on the cause\nRash related to medication\nWhile rash can be caused by HIV co-infections, it can also be caused by medication. Some drugs used to treat HIV or other conditions can cause a rash. \nThis type of rash usually appears within a week or 2 weeks of starting a new medication. Sometimes the rash will clear up on its own. If it doesn\u2019t, a change in medications may be needed.\nRash due to an allergic reaction to medication can be serious. \nOther symptoms of an allergic reaction include:\ntrouble breathing or swallowing \ndizziness \nfever\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a rare allergic reaction to HIV medication. Symptoms include fever and swelling of the face and tongue. A blistering rash, which can involve the skin and mucous membranes, appears and spreads quickly. \nWhen \n30 percent\n of the skin is affected, it\u2019s called toxic epidermal necrolysis, which is a life threatening condition. If this develops, emergency medical care is needed.\nWhile rash can be linked with HIV or HIV medications, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that rashes are common and can have many other causes. \nLearn more about HIV rash.\nHIV symptoms in men: Is there a difference?\nSymptoms of HIV vary from person to person, but they\u2019re similar in men and women. These symptoms can come and go or get progressively worse.\nIf a person has been exposed to HIV, they may also have been exposed to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These include:\ngonorrhea\nchlamydia\nsyphilis\ntrichomoniasis\nMen, and those with a penis, may be more likely than women to notice symptoms of STIs such as sores on their genitals. However, men typically don\u2019t seek medical care as often as women. \nLearn more about HIV symptoms in men.\nHIV symptoms in women: Is there a difference?\nFor the most part, symptoms of HIV are similar in men and women. However, symptoms they experience overall may differ based on the different risks men and women face if they have HIV.\nBoth men and women with HIV are at increased risk for STIs. However, women, and those with a vagina, may be less likely than men to notice small spots or other changes to their genitals.\nIn addition, women with HIV are at increased risk for:\nrecurrent \nvaginal yeast infections\nother vaginal infections, including bacterial vaginosis\npelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nmenstrual cycle changes\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV)\n, which can cause \ngenital warts\n and lead to \ncervical cancer\nWhile not related to HIV symptoms, another risk for women with HIV is that the virus can be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy. However, antiretroviral therapy is considered safe during pregnancy. \nWomen who are treated with antiretroviral therapy are at very low risk for transmitting HIV to their baby during pregnancy and delivery. Breastfeeding is also affected in women with HIV. The virus can be transferred to a baby through breast milk. \nIn the United States and other settings where formula is accessible and safe, it\u2019s recommended that women with HIV \nnot\n breastfeed their babies. For these women, use of formula is encouraged. \nOptions besides formula include \npasteurized banked human milk\n.\nFor women who may have been exposed to HIV, it\u2019s important to know what symptoms to look for. \nLearn more about HIV symptoms in women.\nWhat are the symptoms of AIDS?\nAIDS refers to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. With this condition, the immune system is weakened due to HIV that\u2019s typically gone untreated for many years. \nIf HIV is found and treated early with antiretroviral therapy, a person will usually not develop AIDS.\nPeople with HIV may develop AIDS if their HIV is not diagnosed until late or if they know they have HIV but don\u2019t consistently take their antiretroviral therapy. \nThey may also develop AIDS if they have a type of HIV that\u2019s resistant to (doesn\u2019t respond to) the antiretroviral treatment.\nWithout proper and consistent treatment, people living with HIV can develop AIDS sooner. By that time, the immune system is quite damaged and has a harder time generating a response to infection and disease. \nWith the use of antiretroviral therapy, a person can maintain a chronic HIV diagnosis without developing AIDS for decades.\nSymptoms of AIDS can include:\nrecurrent fever\nchronic swollen lymph glands, especially of the armpits, neck, and groin\nchronic fatigue\nnight sweats\ndark splotches under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids\nsores, spots, or lesions of the mouth and tongue, genitals, or anus\nbumps, lesions, or rashes of the skin\nrecurrent or chronic diarrhea\nrapid weight loss\nneurologic problems such as trouble concentrating, memory loss, and confusion\nanxiety and depression\nAntiretroviral therapy controls the virus and usually prevents progression to AIDS. Other infections and complications of AIDS can also be treated. That treatment must be tailored to the individual needs of the person.\nHIV transmission facts\nAnyone can contract HIV. The virus is transmitted in bodily fluids that include:\nblood\nsemen\nvaginal and rectal fluids\nbreast milk\nSome of the ways HIV is transferred from person to person include:\nthrough vaginal or anal sex \u2014 the most common route of transmission\nby sharing needles, syringes, and other items for injection drug use\nby sharing tattoo equipment without sterilizing it between uses\nduring pregnancy, labor, or delivery from a pregnant person to their baby\nduring breastfeeding\nthrough \u201cpremastication,\u201d or chewing a baby\u2019s food before feeding it to them\nthrough exposure to the blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast milk of someone living with HIV, such as through a needle stick\nThe virus can also be transmitted through a blood transfusion or organ and tissue transplant. However, rigorous testing for HIV among blood, organ, and tissue donors ensures that this is very rare in the United States.\nIt\u2019s theoretically possible, but considered extremely rare, for HIV to be transmitted through:\noral sex (only if there are bleeding gums or open sores in the person\u2019s mouth)\nbeing bitten by a person with HIV (only if the saliva is bloody or there are open sores in the person\u2019s mouth)\ncontact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and the blood of someone living with HIV\nHIV does NOT transfer through:\nskin-to-skin contact\nhugging, shaking hands, or kissing\nair or water\nsharing food or drinks, including drinking fountains\nsaliva, tears, or sweat (unless mixed with the blood of a person with HIV)\nsharing a toilet, towels, or bedding\nmosquitoes or other insects\nIt\u2019s important to note that if a person living with HIV is being treated and has a persistently undetectable viral load, it\u2019s virtually impossible to transmit the virus to another person. \nLearn more about HIV transmission.\nCauses of HIV\nHIV is a variation of a virus that can be transmitted to African chimpanzees. Scientists suspect the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) jumped from chimps to humans when people consumed chimpanzee meat containing the virus. \nOnce inside the human population, the virus mutated into what we now know as HIV. This likely occurred as long ago as the 1920s.\nHIV spread from person to person throughout Africa over the course of several decades. Eventually, the virus migrated to other parts of the world. Scientists first discovered HIV in a human blood sample in 1959.\nIt\u2019s thought that HIV has existed in the United States since the 1970s, but it didn\u2019t start to hit public consciousness until the 1980s. \nLearn more about the history of HIV and AIDS in the United States.\nTreatment options for HIV\nTreatment should begin as soon as possible after a diagnosis of HIV, regardless of viral load. \nThe main treatment for HIV is antiretroviral therapy, a combination of daily medications that stop the virus from reproducing. This helps protect CD4 cells, keeping the immune system strong enough to take measures against disease.\nAntiretroviral therapy helps keep HIV from progressing to AIDS. It also helps reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others.\nWhen treatment is effective, the viral load will be \u201cundetectable.\u201d The person still has HIV, but the virus is not visible in test results. \nHowever, the virus is still in the body. And if that person stops taking antiretroviral therapy, the viral load will increase again, and the HIV can again start attacking CD4 cells. \nLearn more about how HIV treatments work.\nHIV medications\nMany antiretroviral therapy medications \nare approved to treat HIV\n. They work to prevent HIV from reproducing and destroying CD4 cells, which help the immune system generate a response to infection. \nThis helps reduce the risk of developing complications related to HIV, as well as transmitting the virus to others.\nThese antiretroviral medications are grouped into seven classes:\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nprotease inhibitors\nfusion inhibitors\nCCR5 antagonists, also known as entry inhibitors\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitors\nattachment inhibitors\nTreatment regimens\nThe \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\n generally recommends a starting regimen of three HIV medications from at least two of these drug classes. \nThis combination helps prevent HIV from forming resistance to medications. (Resistance means the drug no longer works to treat the virus.)\nMany of the antiretroviral medications are combined with others so that a person with HIV typically takes only one or two pills a day.\nA healthcare provider will help a person with HIV choose a regimen based on their overall health and personal circumstances. \nThese medications must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed. If they\u2019re not taken appropriately, viral resistance can develop, and a new regimen may be needed.\nBlood testing will help determine if the regimen is working to keep the viral load down and the CD4 count up. If an antiretroviral therapy regimen isn\u2019t working, the person\u2019s healthcare provider will switch them to a different regimen that\u2019s more effective.\nSide effects and costs\nSide effects of antiretroviral therapy vary and may include nausea, headache, and dizziness. These symptoms are often temporary and disappear with time. \nSerious side effects can include swelling of the mouth and tongue and liver or kidney damage. If side effects are severe, the medications can be adjusted.\nCosts for antiretroviral therapy vary according to geographic location and type of insurance coverage. Some pharmaceutical companies have assistance programs to help lower the cost. \nLearn more about the drugs used to treat HIV.\nHIV and AIDS: What\u2019s the connection?\nTo develop AIDS, a person has to have contracted HIV. But having HIV doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that someone will develop AIDS.\nCases of HIV progress through three stages:\nstage 1:\n \nacute stage\n, the first few weeks after transmission\nstage 2:\n clinical latency, or chronic stage\nstage 3:\n AIDS\nAs HIV lowers the CD4 cell count, the immune system weakens. A typical adult\u2019s CD4 count is 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with a count below 200 is considered to have AIDS.\nHow quickly a case of HIV progresses through the chronic stage varies significantly from person to person. Without treatment, it can last up to a decade before advancing to AIDS. With treatment, it can last indefinitely.\nThere\u2019s currently no cure for HIV, but it can be managed. People with HIV often have a near-normal lifespan with early treatment with antiretroviral therapy. \nAlong those same lines, there\u2019s technically no cure for AIDS currently. However, treatment can increase a person\u2019s CD4 count to the point where they\u2019re considered to no longer have AIDS. (This point is a count of 200 or higher.) \nAlso, treatment can typically help manage opportunistic infections.\nHIV and AIDS are related, but they\u2019re not the same thing. \nLearn more about the difference between HIV and AIDS.\nCauses of AIDS\nAIDS is caused by HIV. A person can\u2019t get AIDS if they haven\u2019t contracted HIV.\nHealthy individuals have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. Without treatment, HIV continues to multiply and destroy CD4 cells. If a person\u2019s CD4 count falls below 200, they have AIDS.\nAlso, if someone with HIV develops an opportunistic infection associated with HIV, they can still be diagnosed with AIDS, even if their CD4 count is above 200.\nWhat tests are used to diagnose HIV?\nSeveral different \ntests\n can be used to diagnose HIV. Healthcare providers determine which test is best for each person.\nAntibody/antigen tests\nAntibody/antigen tests are the most commonly used tests. They can show positive results typically within \n18\u201345 days\n after someone initially contracts HIV.\nThese tests check the blood for antibodies and antigens. An antibody is a type of protein the body makes to respond to an infection. An antigen, on the other hand, is the part of the virus that activates the immune system.\nAntibody tests\nThese tests check the blood solely for antibodies. Between \n23 and 90 days\n after transmission, most people will develop detectable HIV antibodies, which can be found in the blood or saliva.\nThese tests are done using blood tests or mouth swabs, and there\u2019s no preparation necessary. Some tests provide results in 30 minutes or less and can be performed in a healthcare provider\u2019s office or clinic.\nOther antibody tests can be done at home:\nOraQuick HIV Test.\n An oral swab provides results in as little as 20 minutes.\nHome Access HIV-1 Test System.\n After the person pricks their finger, they send a blood sample to a licensed laboratory. They can remain anonymous and call for results the next business day.\nIf someone suspects they\u2019ve been exposed to HIV but tested negative in a home test, they should repeat the test in 3 months. If they have a positive result, they should follow up with their healthcare provider to confirm.\nNucleic acid test (NAT)\nThis expensive test isn\u2019t used for general screening. It\u2019s for people who have early symptoms of HIV or have a known risk factor. This test doesn\u2019t look for antibodies; it looks for the virus itself. \nIt takes from 5 to 21 days for HIV to be \ndetectable\n in the blood. This test is usually accompanied or confirmed by an antibody test.\nToday, it\u2019s easier than ever to get tested for HIV. \nLearn more about HIV home testing options.\nWhat\u2019s the HIV window period?\nAs soon as someone contracts HIV, it starts to reproduce in their body. The person\u2019s immune system reacts to the antigens (parts of the virus) by producing antibodies (cells that take countermeasures against the virus).\nThe time between exposure to HIV and when it becomes detectable in the blood is called the HIV window period. Most people develop detectable HIV antibodies within 23 to 90 days after transmission.\nIf a person takes an HIV test during the window period, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll receive a negative result. However, they can still transmit the virus to others during this time. \nIf someone thinks they may have been exposed to HIV but tested negative during this time, they should repeat the test in a few months to confirm (the timing depends on the test used). And during that time, they need to use condoms or other barrier methods to prevent possibly spreading HIV.\nSomeone who tests negative during the window might benefit from \npost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\n. This is medication taken \nafter\n an exposure to prevent getting HIV. \nPEP needs to be taken as soon as possible after the exposure; it should be taken no later than 72 hours after exposure but ideally before then.\nAnother way to prevent getting HIV is \npre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n A combination of HIV drugs taken before potential exposure to HIV, PrEP can lower the risk of contracting or transmitting HIV when taken consistently.\nTiming is important when testing for HIV. \nLearn more about how timing affects HIV test results.\nHIV prevention\nAlthough many researchers are working to develop one, there\u2019s currently no vaccine available to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, taking certain steps can help prevent the transmission of HIV.\nSafer sex\nThe most common way for HIV to be transferred is through anal or vaginal sex without a condom or other barrier method. This risk can\u2019t be completely eliminated unless sex is avoided entirely, but the risk can be lowered considerably by taking a few precautions. \nA person concerned about their risk for HIV should:\nGet tested for HIV.\n It\u2019s important they learn their status and that of their partner.\nGet tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n If they test positive for one, they should get it treated, because having an STI increases the risk of contracting HIV.\nUse condoms.\n They should learn the correct way to use condoms and use them every time they have sex, whether it\u2019s through vaginal or anal intercourse. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that pre-seminal fluids (which come out before male ejaculation) can contain HIV.\nTake their medications as directed if they have HIV.\n This lowers the risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual partner.\nShop for condoms online.\nOther prevention methods\nOther steps to help prevent the spread of HIV include:\nAvoid sharing needles or other paraphernalia.\n HIV is transmitted through blood and can be contracted by using materials that have come in contact with the blood of someone who has HIV.\nConsider PEP.\n A person who has been exposed to HIV should contact their healthcare provider about obtaining post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP can reduce the risk of contracting HIV. It consists of three antiretroviral medications given for 28 days. PEP should be started as soon as possible after exposure but before 36 to 72 hours have passed.\nConsider PrEP.\n A person has a higher chance of contracting HIV should talk to their healthcare provider about \npre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)\n. If taken consistently, it can lower the risk of acquiring HIV. PrEP is a combination of two drugs available in pill form.\nHealthcare providers can offer more information on these and other ways to prevent the spread of HIV. \nCheck here for more information on STI prevention.\nLiving with HIV: What to expect and tips for coping\nMore than 1.\n2\n million people\n in the United States are living with HIV. It\u2019s different for everybody, but with treatment, many can expect to live a long, productive life.\nThe most important thing is to start antiretroviral treatment as soon as possible. By taking medications exactly as prescribed, people living with HIV can keep their viral load low and their immune system strong. \nIt\u2019s also important to follow up with a healthcare provider regularly.\nOther ways people living with HIV can improve their health include:\nMake their health their top priority.\n Steps to help people living with HIV feel their best include: \nfueling their body with a well-balanced diet\nexercising regularly\ngetting plenty of rest\navoiding tobacco and other drugs\nreporting any new symptoms to their healthcare provider right away\nFocus on their mental health. \nThey could consider seeing a licensed therapist who is experienced in treating people with HIV.\nUse safer sex practices.\n Talk to their sexual partner(s). Get tested for other STIs. And use condoms and other barrier methods every time they have vaginal or anal sex.\nTalk to their healthcare provider about PrEP and PEP. \nWhen used consistently by a person without HIV, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can lower the chances of transmission. PrEP is most often recommended for people without HIV in relationships with people with HIV, but it can be used in other situations as well. Online sources for finding a PrEP provider include \nPrEP Locator\n and \nPleasePrEPMe\n.\nSurround themselves with loved ones. \nWhen first telling people about their diagnosis, they can start slow by telling someone who can maintain their confidence. They may want to choose someone who won\u2019t judge them and who will support them in caring for their health.\nGet support. \nThey can join an HIV support group, either in person or online, so they can meet with others who face the same concerns they have. Their healthcare provider can also steer them toward a variety of resources in their area.\nThere are many ways to get the most out of life when living with HIV. \nHear some real stories of people living with HIV.\nHIV life expectancy: Know the facts\nIn the 1990s, a 20-year-old person with HIV had a \n19-year life expectancy\n. By 2011, a 20-year-old person with HIV could expect to live another 53 years.\nIt\u2019s a dramatic improvement, due in large part to antiretroviral therapy. With proper treatment, many people with HIV can expect a normal or near- normal lifespan.\nOf course, many things affect life expectancy for a person with HIV. Among them are:\nCD4 cell count\nviral load\nserious HIV-related illnesses, including hepatitis\nmisusing drugs\nsmoking\naccess, adherence, and response to treatment\nother health conditions\nage\nWhere a person lives also matters. People in the United States and other developed countries may be more likely to have access to antiretroviral therapy. \nConsistent use of these drugs helps prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. When HIV advances to AIDS, life expectancy without treatment is about \n3 years\n. \nIn 2017, about \n20.9 million people\n living with HIV were using antiretroviral therapy.\nLife expectancy statistics are just general guidelines. People living with HIV should talk to their healthcare provider to learn more about what they can expect. \nLearn more about life expectancy and long-term outlook with HIV.\nIs there a vaccine for HIV?\nCurrently, there are no vaccines to prevent or treat HIV. Research and testing on experimental vaccines are ongoing, but none are close to being approved for general use.\nHIV is a complicated virus. It mutates (changes) rapidly and is often able to fend off immune system responses. Only a small number of people who have HIV develop broadly neutralizing antibodies, the kind of antibodies that can respond to a range of HIV strains.\nThe first \nHIV vaccine efficacy study\n in 7 years was underway in South Africa in 2016. The experimental vaccine is an updated version of one used in a 2009 trial that took place in Thailand. \nA 3.5-year follow-up after vaccination showed the vaccine was 31.2 percent effective in preventing HIV transmission. \nThe study involves 5,400 men and women from South Africa. In 2016 in South Africa, about \n270,000 people\n contracted HIV. The results of the study are expected in \n2021\n.\nOther late-stage, multinational vaccine clinical trials are also \ncurrently underway\n.\nOther research into an HIV vaccine is also ongoing. \nWhile there\u2019s still no vaccine to prevent HIV, people with HIV can benefit from other vaccines to prevent HIV-related illnesses. Here are the CDC recommendations:\npneumonia:\n \nrecommended\n for all children younger than 2 and all adults 65 and older\ninfluenza:\n \nrecommended\n for all people over 6 months old annually with rare exceptions\nhepatitis A and B:\n ask your doctor if you should get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B, especially if you are in a \nhigher risk group\nmeningitis:\n the meningococcal conjugate vaccination is \nrecommended\n for all preteens and teens at 11 to 12 years old with a booster dose at 16, or anyone at risk. The serogroup B meningococcal vaccination is recommended for anyone 10 years or older with increased risk.\nshingles:\n \nrecommended\n for those ages 50 or older\nLearn why an HIV vaccine is so difficult to develop.\nHIV statistics\nHere are today\u2019s HIV numbers:\nIn 2019, about \n38 million\n people worldwide were living with HIV. Of those, 1.8 million were children below the age 15 years.\nAt the end of 2019, \n25.4 million\n people living with HIV were using antiretroviral therapy.\nSince the pandemic began, \n75.7 million\n people have contracted HIV, and AIDS-related complications have claimed 32.7 million lives.\nIn 2019, \n690,000\n people died from AIDS-related diseases. This is a decline from 1.9 million in 2005.\nEastern and Southern Africa are the hardest hit. In 2019, \n20.7 million\n people in these areas were living with HIV, and 730,000 more contracted the virus. The region has more than half of all people living with HIV worldwide.\nAdult and adolescent women accounted for \n19 percent\n of new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2018. Almost half of all new cases occur in African Americans.\nLeft untreated, a woman with HIV has a \n15\u201345 percent\n chance of passing HIV to her baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding. With antiretroviral therapy throughout pregnancy and avoidance of breastfeeding, the risk is less than \n5 percent\n.\nIn the 1990s, a 20-year-old person with HIV had a \nlife expectancy\n of 19 years. By 2011, it had improved to 53 years. Today, life expectancy is \nnear normal\n if antiretroviral therapy is started soon after contracting HIV.\nAs access to antiretroviral therapy continues to improve around the world, these statistics will hopefully keep changing. \nLearn more statistics about HIV.\nHow we reviewed this article:\nSources\nHistory\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
